A recipe site using [cooklang](https://cooklang.org/) as the data format.

Iterating on the [previous implementation](https://github.com/gardenrobot/cookbook), this generates static html and triggers on file updates, rather than a Flask webapp.

UI based on the official app, with some changes that I have found helpful for reading in the kitchen.

Check out my cookbook [here](https://cookbook.samclot.com/)!
